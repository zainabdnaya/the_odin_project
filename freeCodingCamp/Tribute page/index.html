                    <p>Alan Turing (1912–1954) was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and computer scientist.</p>
                    <p>Alan Mathison Turing was a brilliant British mathematician of the early twentieth century, considered by many to be the father of the computer </p>
                    <p> he contributed decisively to decoding German messages in World War II, 
                    which was crucial for the Allies in defeating Nazi Germany. </p>
                    <p>He was born on June 23, 1912, in England, into a typical family, where his parents often traveled to India.</p>
                    <p>He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical </p>
                    <p>In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University</p>
                    <p> During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence.</p>

                    <p>The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who called it an (automatic machine) With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is "circular" (=> freezes, or fails to continue its computational task)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                                 Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol?</p>

                             <p>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. </p><p>In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers</p>    
                        <p>Alan Turing made an amazing, great contribution to math in many fields at once he was a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and computer scientist even in biomathematics </p><p> unfortunately, he wasn't awarded enough when he was alive, maybe because he came in critical time and his work interfere directly with World war 2. </p>
                        <p> even his death wasn't 100% suicide there is a theory he could be poisoned by someone [many spies were sent to keep an eye on him  (not in a good way)]</p>
